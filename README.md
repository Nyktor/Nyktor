# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nyktor
I'm a total absolute fucking INTP nerd that is interested in programming and computer science.

And because I hate Spain's education system, I'm learning by myself.

I upload my progress here.
## âœ¨ Interests
Programming and puter science. I enjoy **solving puzzles** and learning new things. The more mentally challenging, the better.

I also like videogames, anime and kitties.
## ðŸŒ± Learnings (self-taught)
**Currently learnt/learning:**
* C
* Java (OOP)
* Git + GitHub
* Linux OS (Debian 11 "Bullseye" distro)
* Basic, simple DSA

**Future plans on learning:**
* C++
* Internet concepts like HTTP and stuff
* HTML + CSS + JavaScript
* Databases, SQL & stuff
* More complex DSA
* M a t h

**Things that I do NOT discard learning:**
* Cryptography
* Cybersecurity
* Game Development
